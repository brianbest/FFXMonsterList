# FFX Monster & Stat Manager

This repository hosts a fresh rewrite of the Final Fantasy X monster tracking project. The app will manage monster information, capture progress and battle tips.

```
backend/  - Express service providing API endpoints and loading data from JSON
frontend/ - React based UI for browsing monsters and tracking captures
location-monster-data/ - JSON files containing monster stats by area
```

This is an early skeleton â€“ data and API routes will expand over time.
